        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The community organizes many annual events and contests, such as

            <a href="http://wikilovesearth.org/">Wiki Loves Earth</a>. By using the app
            you can easily take pictures when you come across a landmark that might be
            missing a picture, requires a different angle, or has not been photographed for a while.
            Also, you can <a href="#contributions-ongoing-campaigns">learn about ongoing campaigns</a>
            right from within the app!
